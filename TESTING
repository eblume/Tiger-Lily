To test Tiger Lily to ensure that the source you have passes all of the unit
tests (thus helping to ensure correctness and validity), simply run the
test.sh executable script provided at the root directory along side this file.

Testing Tiger Lily in this manner requires that 'nose' be installed. 'nose' is
a testing framework for python that can be downloaded from:
    http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/

Note that 'nose' requires a bit of extra work to install on Python 3 at this
time: you will also need to install 'Distribute', a package for Python 3 which
completely replaces setuptools (indeed, it wraps setuptools completely, such
that it will become your new setuptools-like distribution system). Distribute
can be downloaded from:
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute

Installing Distribute is fairly straightforward, please read the documentation
available on the above site.




To add new tests, you may either:
    * Add doctests to the docstrings of functions, classes, and modules you add.
      (This is the preferred method.)
    * Create a 'test.py' file inside of the module directory and either create
      unittest.TestCase objects inside of that, OR simply write functions that
      take no arguments and return no values with the word 'test' in them.

    See the Nose documentation for more information, noting that the Tiger Lily
    testing protocol allows for executable files and doctests to be tested.
