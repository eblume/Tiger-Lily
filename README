==INSTALLATION==

See INSTALLATION. This is a standard distutils setup, if you already know the
procedure.

==USING PYTHON 2.x==

It is entirely possible that Tiger Lily is completely backwards compatible
with Python 2.x, particularly Python2.7+. This will be unsupported and untested.

==PACKAGE INFORMATION==

Nothing at this time. (Check back later!)

==RELEASE HISTORY==

Wow, you're reading this before any releases have been made. Aren't you special!

==CONTRIBUTION==

To contribute to Tiger Lily, please visit the project's main page at
<https://bitbucket.org/eblume/tiger-lily/overview>.

There are many ways to contribute. Some of them are:
* File bug reports in the Issues tab of the project page.
* Edit the wiki on the project page to update documentation, etc.
* Submit patches to the project page by adding a file to a new issue
  with an appropriate title.
* Or, best of all, clone the project! You can choose to then develop
  independently or (and I would humbly suggest this is the better option),
  once the changes are ready, submit a push request to the main project.

As always, you can contact the author at <blume.erich@gmail.com>.
