INSTALLATION

Tiger Lily includes a python source file called setup.py at the top level of
its directory structure, which should be the same folder this README file is
located in.

To install the packages provided by Tiger Lily, it may be sufficient to type 
(at a command line):

> python setup.py install

However, depending on your environment, you will likely need to provide a bit
of guidance to your OS, such as the following command:

> sudo env python3 setup.py install

See <http://docs.python.org/py3k/install/index.html#install-index> for more
information on installing python packages using distutils.

At this time no additional software or libraries should be required.
