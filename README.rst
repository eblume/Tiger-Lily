INSTALLATION
============

See INSTALLATION. This is a standard setuptools setup, if you already know the
procedure.

USING PYTHON 2.x
----------------

Tigerlily does not support Python 2.x, and no plans exist to provide such
support. For a strong biological sciences python package for python 2,
see biopython: http://www.biopython.org

DOCUMENTATION
=============

For documentation, see TigerLily.pdf in the base project folder.

This documentation may be out of date depending on whether or not the developers
did their job and re-generated the documentation before the release. If you
suspect that the documentation is out of date, or if you are using code from
the repository (and not from a release), you can re-generate the documentation
by going in to the 'docs' folder and executing 'make tigerlily'.

This documentation generation process uses several non-standard applications
including Sphinx. Installation of these packages is beyond the scope of this
document, but as a tip, note that as of this writing Sphinx is not ported to
python 3, so you need to get the development version. Be sure to run the unit
tests of Sphinx if you do this. See 
http://groups.google.com/group/sphinx-dev/browse_thread/thread/42a35bf1ccd91794/8a7d536cca879e5f
for pointers.
