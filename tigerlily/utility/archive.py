"""Tools for extracting files from common archive formats like .tar.gz and .zip.

Additionally includes helper functions to extract common sequence formats from
these archives without actually 'inflating' the archive on the disk.

class Archive:
    """Common interface for extracting file objects from common archive formats.

    When initializing, you must specify either *filepath* or *data* but not
    both. In general, prefer to use *filepath* as it prevents using a layer of
    abstraction to provide a file-like object to the underlying archive formats,
    but either will work more or less equivalently.

    The format of the archive will be automatically detected without using the
    file name or extension.

    This interface is **read-only**, and no plans to add file writing exist at
    this time.

    Currently supported formats are (again, recall that extensions may be
    arbitrary):
    .tar
    .tar.gz
    .tar.bz2
    .zip

    In all cases the archive may contain one file or many files. If the 
    archive has a nested folder structure, this structure will be ignored and
    all file members will be scanned without regard to their placement in the
    arhcive's folder structure.
