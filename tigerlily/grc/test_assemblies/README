Test Assemblies
===============

Creating a New Test Assembly
----------------------------

1. Think up a (new, unused) name for your test with no spaces that starts with
   the word 'test', like 'test1' or 'testfasta' or 'test_with_a_LONG_name'. We
   will just use the identifier <test> to refer to this name from now on.

2. Create an empty file called <test>.txt in this folder.

3. Add one sequence per line to <test>.txt with no spaces - each sequence will
   become an individual 'assembly unit' (chromosome) in the reference genome
   assembly. Try to keep the sequences short for testing purposes, although
   there is no limit - just recall that you can't wrap a sequence on to a second
   line (ie, if you want a 250 million nucleotide sequence then you will need a
   250 million character long line. I would avoid making such a long sequence.)

   By the way, in the resulting assembly each line is called 'chrN', where N is
   the line the sequence occured on.

4. Open Makefile in a text editor, and add <test>.tar.gz to the TEST_ASSEMBLIES
   variable.

5. Run 'make all' to regenerate every test assembly, or just 'make <test>' to
   generate your own.

If your test assembly is for personal use, you are now done. If you want to
distribute it to the project repository, continue to 6:

6. Re-execute the full project test suite at the main project directory
   (test.sh)

7. Please check in both the source assembly (the .txt) as well as the
   generated archive file (the .tar.gz) and the updated Makefile.


You may also use the 'txt2assembly' tool which takes assembly text files from
STDIN and writes assembly archives to STDOUT, but please consider using the
Makefile to avoid errors.


Updating an Existing Test Assembly
----------------------------------

This process is very straightforward.

1. Edit <test>.txt to reflect your changes.

2. Assuming that <test> is in the Makefile, just run 'make all' or 'make <test>'

3. Check in the result to git if desired, and you're done.
