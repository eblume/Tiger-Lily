    NCBI has released many top-quality reference genomes. As of late 2010, these
    assemblies are produced under the brand of the GRC - the Genome Reference
    Consortium. The UCSC Genome Browser mirrors each of these assemblies in
    such a way that makes it very conveniant to download and extract data that
    is useful to Tiger Lily.

    This class provides an interface to automatically download, store, load,
    parse, and extract sequences from the UCSC Genome Browser's copies of the
    GRC reference genomes.

    Support for different assemblies will be added manually to this class. For
    a list of supported assemblies by their name, see SUPPORTED_ASSEMBLIES .
    The default (most current) assembly will be stored in DEFAULT_ASSEMBLY

    For the convenience of faster non-networked tests, extremely small made-up
    reference genomes are provided inside of this package in a folder called
    'test_assemblies'. They can be loaded either by using the GRCGenome.load
    method (as normal), or else by using GRCGenome.download with names that
    start with 'test' (eg. 'test1', 'test2', 'testnomask', etc.).

        Fetches the named reference assembly (default is DEFAULT_ASSEMBLY) from
        the web, and creates a new GRCGenome object to handle it.

        If store is False (default), the data will be kept in a temporary file,
        and will be destroyed as soon as the object is released. If True,
        the .tar.gz of the entire assembly will be saved in the current
        directory - ValueError will be raised if this file seems to already
        exist. If store is a string, it will be assumed to be a path to a
        directory (trailing slash optional) in which the .tar.gz archive should
        be stored. (Again, ValueError will be raised if the file already
        exists.) If necessary, any intermiediate directories will be created.

        If silent is False, status messages will be printed using print() to 
        keep the user informed of the progress. This is usually very important
        in command line applications as the reference archives are about 900 MB
        in size and may take minutes or hours to download depending on the
        internet connection.

        Because of the large size of these files, it is highly recommended that
        the store option be set. Please do not use Tiger Lily to abuse the
        UCSC Genome Browser group's generosity in hosting these large files to
        the general public.
