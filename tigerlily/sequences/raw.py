from . import sequence

class RawSequence(sequence.PolymerSequence):
    """Container for a 'raw' sequence.

    Since raw reads are essentially just a sequence, this is a fairly useless
    class. It is more or less just a holder for the Raw sequence group object.

    >>> seq = RawSequence(sequence='ATCGCGAGTCAGTCAGCATGACTACGCACAGTAC')
    
    One possible use of this container is to create Raw sequences that know
    their identifier. Raw sequences that are given an identifier don't forget
    it and will happily send it when being converted to and from different
    formats. They just don't ever use them in output.

    >>> seq = RawSequence(sequence='LALL',identifier='seq1')
    
    An example converting from Raw to FASTA and back, to prove it works:

    >>> from . import sequence
    >>> fasta = seq.convert(sequence.FASTASequence)
    >>> seq2 = fasta.convert(RawSequence)
    >>> seq.sequence == fasta.sequence == seq2.sequence == 'LALL'
    True
    >>> seq.identifier == fasta.identifier == seq2.identifier == 'seq1'
    True
