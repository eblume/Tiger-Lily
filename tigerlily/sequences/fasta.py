"""Support for the NCBI FASTA format.

contain any comments (only a single identifier line is allowed), and that '>'
is the only valid identifier character (not ';').

class FASTASequence(FormattedSequence):
    r"""Container for a single FASTA Sequence.

    To parse a list of FASTA sequences out of a FASTA-formatted file, use
    ``parseFASTA()`` from this module. To create a FASTA-formatted file
    from a list of (any type of) sequence, use ``writeFASTA()``.

    You can also instantiate ``FASTASequence``
    objects directly. There is often little
    point in doing so, but it is an option available to you. Keep in mind
    that ``FASTASequence`` objects *need* both a sequence and an identifier.

    ``FASTASequence`` sequences must use a subset of the NCBI specification.
    The sequence must only contain uppercase or lowercase variants of the
    characters in either ``FASTASequence.ALLOWED_NUCLEIC_CHARS`` or
    ``FASTASequence.ALLOWD_AMINO_CHARS``. You can override the variables or
    (preferably) subclass ``FASTASequence`` to allow different characters in
    the sequence (and you are encouraged to do so),
    but you then lose the gauruntee that the resulting
    sequence will always be NCBI-portable. Note that 'degenerate' sequences
    and some other control or meta sequences are not supported in this
    implementation even though the NCBI specification does allow them - this
    is for interoperability with other Tiger Lily sequence classes.=
