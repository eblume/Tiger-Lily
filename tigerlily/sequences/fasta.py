    def __init__(self,file=None,data=None):
        r"""Load a FASTA set either from the given source.

        file may point to a file-like object from which the source data will
        be read. data may point to a string in which the same will be done.

        If both file and data are set, ValueError will be raised. You may
        create an empty FASTA object if you like by specifying neither.

        Note that this formatter uses the NCBI definition of the FASTA format,
        which you can find at this URL:
            http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml
        However, no checking is done to make sure that the sequence is composed
        of valid bases - that's between you and your end use case.

        Importantly, the NCBI definition does not allow for comments and
        mandates '>' as the decleration row's prefix, which is honored here.

        Example:

        >>> data = ">seq1\nLCLYTHGIGRN\n>seq2\nVALAGVHLTFLHETGSNN"
        >>> seqs = FASTA(data=data)
        >>> len(seqs)
        2

        We can then iterate over the FASTASequence sequences in this group:

        >>> for seq in seqs:
        ...     isinstance(seq,FASTASequence)
        ...     seq.identifier,seq.sequence
        ...
        True
        ('seq1', 'LCLYTHGIGRN')
        True
        ('seq2', 'VALAGVHLTFLHETGSNN')

        Here is some proof that the various inheritance schemes are working:

        >>> isinstance(seqs,FASTA)
        True
        >>> isinstance(seqs,PolymerSequenceGroup)
        True
        >>> issubclass(FASTA,PolymerSequenceGroup)
