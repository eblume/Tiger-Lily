    In general this is not an 'input' or 'output' format, but rather an
    internal format that constrains the sequence to a certain set of
    allowed characters in the sequence.

    The set of characters allowed is the following:
        ATGC
    If a sequence is converted to a NucleicSequence and doesn't fit that
    set, ValueError will be raised.

    NucleicSequence objects do not have a valid write() method, nor do
    they have a valid format() method. (Instead they will raise
    NotImplementedError.)

        Conversion is performed by taking each codon and replacing it with
        the corresponding amino acid. In biological terms,
        translate() assumes that the NucleicSequence object's sequence is
        the coding sequence (and not the template). Incidentally, to get
        the coding sequence of a template, just call
        template.reverse_complement().

        reading_frame is either 1, 2, or 3, and corresponds to the 1-based
        offset into the sequence from which to begin collecting codons. In
        other words, reading_frame=1 (the default) will start from the first
        base in the sequence, and reading_frame=2 from the 2nd, and so on.
        Higher values are allowed and will start further in to the sequence by
        skipping codons that would otherwise have been in the reading frame.

        use_control_codes is a flag which, when True, enables an alternative
        processing algorithm. The new algorithm is like the first one (including
        the reading_frame), but after processing has finished the following
        constraint is placed upon the strand: all amino acids prior to and
        including the first Methionine (M/ATG) will be removed, and all amino
        acids after the first STOP codon (*/TAA,TGA,TAG) will be removed. If
        no Methionine is detected, ValueError will be raised. (It is not
        necessary for there to be a STOP codon.)

        We can also specify a reading_frame even though it will mean that the
        given input sequence doesn't cleanly subdivide in to codons - this is
        not an error.
