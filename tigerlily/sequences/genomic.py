    In general this is not an 'input' or 'output' format, but rather an
    internal format that constrains the sequence to a certain set of
    allowed characters in the sequence.

    Those characters are captured by the regular expression
        [atgcATGCN]+
    If a sequence is converted to a GenomicSequence and doesn't fit that
    regular expression, ValueError will be raised.

    GenomicSequence objects do not have a valid write() method, nor do
    they have a valid format() method. (Instead they will raise
    NotImplementedError.)
