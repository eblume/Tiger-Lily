        the header row on FASTA sequences), however, some data sources have
        no given identifier. In this case it is better to give SOME sort of
        contextualizing identifier than to give up and use a placeholder like
        'Unknown'. An example would be to return the line number the sequence
        occured on, or the file that the sequence was contained in, or the
        date and time the sequence was processed, etc.
