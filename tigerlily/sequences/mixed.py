class MixedSequenceGroup(PolymerSequenceGroup):
    r"""PolymerSequenceGroup that allows sequences of any type.
    
    What this gains in flexibility, it loses in representation. This
    subclass of PolymerSequenceGroup does not have a .write() method, since
    there probably isn't a good way to represent the sequences it contains.

    We also gain an add() method, which allows additional sequences to be
    added to the sequence group after initialization - perhaps the key
    benefit of a MixedSequenceGroup.
