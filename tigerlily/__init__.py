# VERSION_INFO
# A tuple of strings (version,release).
#    version - A string of the form A.B where A is the 'Major Version' and
#              B is the 'Minor Version'.
#    release - The name of the release that this particular instance (or tag)
#              of the package comes from. This will generally be of the form
#              MAJOR.MINOR.RELEASE_NUMBER for final releases, with the following
#              alternate forms for non-final releases:
#
#              MAJOR.MINOR.RELEASE_NUMBER-rc# : A Release Candidate, the #th in
#                                               the series for this release.
#               
#              MAJOR.MINOR-dev : A development build. This is not actually
#                                 a 'release' at all.
